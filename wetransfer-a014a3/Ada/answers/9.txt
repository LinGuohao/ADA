Q : What are the differences between a subtype and a new type?

Subtype is generated subset of the base type, still being equivalent to base type.
Subtype differences from new type are:
- Subtypes can be used in place of parent types.
- Values: New types create distinct sets of values, subtype values are subsets
- Operations:
    - Input and output: New types require new I/O package, subtypes don't
    - Assignment: Distinct numeric types cannot be assigned to one another without conversion, subtypes of numberic types can be assigned to one another without conversion (although conversion is allowed).
    - Overflow checks: With gnatmake, subtype assignment (ie subtype := supertype) checks for constraint error. With new types, checking may or may not occur by default.
Note : Arithmetic and relational operators, assignment, and conversions are automatically defined for new types as well subtypes of course.
Example of subtype : subtype MonthDay is Integer range 1 .. 31;
Example of new type : type MonthDay is range 1 .. 31;
