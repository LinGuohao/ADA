Q : What type of parameters can be used at generics? How can we instantiate generics?

The generic unit declares generic formal parameters, which can be:
    objects (of mode in or in out but never out)
    types
    subprograms
    instances of another, designated, generic unit.
In instantiating, we match the parameters that we need for the generic for example:
that is the generic:
    generic
    type T is private;
    with function "<" (A, B: T) return Boolean is <>;
    function Maximum ( A, B: T ) return T;
and that is how we instantiate it:
    function I_Max is new Maximum( Integer, "<" );
    function I_Min is new Maximum( Integer, ">" );
    function F_Max is new Maximum( Float );
