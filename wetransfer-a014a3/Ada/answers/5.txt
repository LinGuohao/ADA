Q. How can we declare pointers?

add : all to acess, more examples
pointers in Ada are called Access types, and it points to an object located in certain address. We have different kind of access types
in Ada and they are : Pool access, General access, Anonymous access and  Access to subprogram types.
In order to declare a pool access type (pointer) in Ada, first you give base type, then you put type, name, is access, base type.
Example:-
type TArray is array( Integer range <> ) of Character;
type Pointer is access TArray;
Note: after just intialization the pointer is pointing to nothing (NULL).
