Q : How can we define default operators?

looking to the below snippet of code, we can see that having such a definiation for default operators
makes it easy on instantiation with types having this operator(s) already and makes the user life easer in general.
    generic
    type T is private;
    with function "<" (A, B: T) return Boolean is <>;
and for instantiation:
    function I_Max is new Maximum( Integer, "<" );
    function I_Min is new Maximum( Integer, ">" );
    function F_Max is new Maximum( Float );
