Q : How can we define records? What kind of records can be used?

A record is a composite type that groups one or more fields. A field can be of any type, even a record.
that is how we define record without discriminated :-
 type Basic_Record is record
       A : Integer;
    end record;
and that is the definiation for record with discriminated :-
    type Discriminated_Record (Size : Natural) is record
       A : String (1 .. Size);
    end record;
There are a lot of type of records in Ada i.e, "Null Record". But we focused this semester about basic records
(records without discriminated) and discriminated record (record with discriminated).
