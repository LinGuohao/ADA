Q : What are the control sequences in Ada?

As any programming language Ada has many control sequences and I will brifly mention some of them.
If statements are used to deal with having a decision which will consequences based on it. so we will have a condition and extraction based on the result of the logicat condition.
Example:
if condition then
    do_something
end if;
In Ada, we have many kind of loops.
Example1:-
while I <=10 loop
    Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put( I );
    I := I + 1;
end loop;
this will loop will run till the condition will become false.
Example2:-
for variable in range loop
    statements;
end loop;
this will loop for exact amount of time, and in this implentation i will be equal to different number in this range in every iteration.
Example3:-
loop
    statements;
    exit when condition;
end loop;
Similar to while loop but different implentation that make sure that at least, it will run once.
