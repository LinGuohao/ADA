Q : Write examples of arrays and enumerate their attributes.

An array is a collection of elements which can be accessed by one or more index values. 
In Ada any definite type is allowed as element and any discrete type, i.e. Range, Modular or Enumeration, can be used as an index.
Examples:-
type Character_Counter is array (Character) of Natural; -- array of characters.
type Temperature is range -10 .. +40; -- As I mentioned above, any discrete type can be used as index.
type Experiment is array (Temperature ) of Integer;
type String is array (Positive range <>) of Character; -- the indeces can be range of the discrete type.

As we expect, since the array is very famous very famous data structure, there are a lot of attributes for it.
But there are four attributes and they are the most important. And they are :'First, 'Last, 'Length and 'Range.
And that is a brief explaination of their role with examples if needed.
'First : returns the index of first element of the array.
'Last : returns the index of last element of the array.
'Length : return the Length of the array.
'Range : return the range of the array, used a lot in for loops.
Example:
 for I in World'Range loop
   ... World (I)...
 end loop;
